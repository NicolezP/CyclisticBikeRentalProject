Google Data Analyst capstone project
Refer to jupyter notebook for details on data cleaning and visualizations

## The Business
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, launched a successful program in 2016. Since then, the program expended its fleet of 5,824 bikes and 692 geotracked stations across the city, allowing flexible rental and return options.<br>
Cyclistic's marketing strategy had focused on broad consumer awareness and offers flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

## The Task
The company's marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.<br>
The data analyst team is tasked to understand how casual rides and annual members use Cyclist differently. Using these insights to then design a new marketing strategy to convert casual rides into annual members
