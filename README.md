## The Business
![](Images/Cyclistic%20logo.JPG)<br>
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company, launched a successful program in 2016. Since then, the program expended its fleet of 5,824 bikes and 692 geotracked stations across the city, allowing flexible rental and return options.<br>
Cyclistic's marketing strategy had focused on broad consumer awareness and offers flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

## The Task
The company's marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.<br>
The data analyst team is tasked to understand how casual rides and annual members use Cyclist differently. Using these insights to then design a new marketing strategy to convert casual rides into annual members

## Analyze


## Insights
### **Observations:**<br> 
*    Members and casual riders have different usage patterns
*    Members account for most rides
*    Members make consistent short rides throughout the week, likely commuting to work
*    On weekends, member rides increase slightly in number and length but remain shorter than casual users' rides
*    Rides increase during warmer months from May to September
*    There is a preference for classic bikes over electric bikes
### **Recommendations:**
*    Focus on acquiring new customers for memberships rather than converting casual riders
*    Offer limited-time discounts for annual sign-ups from May to September
*    Offer discounted rates during morning and evening commutes to entice sign-ups
*    Maintain and support the existing membership base by introducing loyalty program where points can be redeemed for free ride minutes
*    Offer discounts on pre-paid cheaper ride credits and significant discounts for multi-year memberships
*    Proximity of bike stations to starting points and destinations influences membership signups.
*    Advertise around train and bus stops near bike stations to raise awareness
*    Implement referral codes providing discounts to both referrers and new members
